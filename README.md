# GPI-2 Example

This example project contains similar connections to the one I made for my internship  

The project uses [GPI-2 API](http://github.com/cc-hpc-itwm/GPI-2) which implements the [GASPI specification](http://gaspi.de)  

The code is highly commented and I hope that is very easy to read for people who already know the MPI framework
