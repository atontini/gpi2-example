# GPI-2 Example

This is an example which has the same connection I have written on my bachelor stage.  
The project uses [GPI-2 API](http://github.com/cc-hpc-itwm/GPI-2) which implements the [GASPI specification](http://gaspi.de)  
The code is highly commented and I hope that is very easy to read for people who already know the MPI framework
